        <p>
          We use Google Analytics to collect information about your use of our
          website. This information consists of information such as how often you
          visit our website, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other
          sites you used prior to coming to our website. We use the information we
          get from Google Analytics only to improve our website. Google
          Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you
          visit our website, rather than your name or other identifying
          information. We do not combine the information collected through the use
          of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although
          Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to
          identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the
          cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and
          share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to
          our website is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the
          Google Privacy Policy.
